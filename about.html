                As a newbie skydiver, I struggle a lot with getting my accuracy landings right. I tend to make same mistakes over and over again, especially on an unfamiliar dropzone or in high winds:
                my final legs are often too long or too short, I sometimes fly with the wind for too long, making it impossible to get where I intended to land. I believe that the reason for that is the lack of
                intuition of how my canopy behaves in the air in strong winds. Given my low jump numbers, I haven't really had a chance to develop the intuition yet. That's why I decided to create a simple
                tool to emulate the behaviour of ram-air canopy in the air, hoping that playing with the tool will help with that to some extent. Given how hard this stuff can be for me, there are probably other
                inexperienced skydivers out there who will find this tool at least somewhat useful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is what I think this tool can be used for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Practicing different landing patterns in strong winds.</li>
                    <li>Getting an idea of where can you make it back from under your main or reserve.</li>
                    <li>Entering the current wind conditions before the jump and getting a rough idea of what to expect under canopy.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The simulation is quite simple and aimed to reflect the experience of skydivers with low jump numbers. The canopy is assumed to be loaded quite moderately: it has 10 m/s (22.4 mph) horizontal and 5 m/s (11.2 mph)
                vertical speed with no breaks applied, zero horizontal and 10 m/s (22.4 mph) vertical speed with breaks fully depressed, 7.5 m/s (16.8 mph) horizontal and 3.0 m/s (6.7 mph) vertical speed in quarter breaks. I took this numbers from a Russian book on skydiving,
                and, hopefully, they somewhat resemble the real experience. At least, the fact that you can go further by applying some breaks when you are upwind seems to be simulated correctly.
                All turns are assumed to be flat, that is, slow and with no altitude loss.
            </p>
            <p>
                The landing pattern is computed assuming an approach with slightly depressed breaks. The altitudes of the turning points are 300m (985ft), 200m (656ft) and 100m (328ft).
            </p>

                If you have any suggestions on improving the tool, want me to add a new dropzone or to buy me a beer, feel free to drop an email to boris.jangel [at] gmail [dot] com. Also, the source code
                is available on <a href="https://github.com/hr0nix/BlueSkies">github</a>, and I'm more than willing to accept pull requests.
